<h2 id="mental-health-and-student-services">Mental Health and Student Services</h2>

<p>The school doesn’t appear to be keeping up with the increase in demand for student mental health resources even as enrolment continues to rise. This is especially a problem in engineering, with our incredibly stressful schedules. Furthermore, access to mental health resources in times of increased demand (midterms and finals) are still inadequate. Therefore, as students, we need to do more to help each other, because we can’t wait for the faculty to improve mental health support.</p>

<h3 id="create-student-support-groups">Create Student Support Groups</h3>

<p>Sometimes the best way for students to handle stress is by venting their problems to other people. The idea behind creating student support groups would be to have a medium to just tell people what is stressing them out. By having a group of other students to talk to about this, others could suggest ideas to deal with the stress from class, relationships, jobs, etc. Additionally, having other students around with similar problems can make someone feel like they aren’t the only one struggling with these issues. Overall, this can be front-line support for students that are stressed out by exams that just need someone to talk to, while leaving more serious cases for the school’s support staff.</p>

<h3 id="organize-upper-lower-year-study-sessions">Organize Upper-Lower Year Study Sessions</h3>

<p>There are a lot of lower year students (especially first years), that are a lot more comfortable asking for help from a fellow student, rather than a TA or professor. Upper year students have done most of these courses before and are knowledgable in the course material. Another issue is that there are a lot of lower year students who do not know the upper year students in their program. To fix this I would organize upper-lower year study sessions where an upper year student could run a tutorial or help lower year students with concepts in their coursework. This would also foster a better relationship between classes and help lower students do well in their courses.</p>

<h3 id="create-an-engineering-tutoring-program">Create an Engineering Tutoring Program</h3>

<p>Similar to study sessions, some students can be struggling with one course in particular in a term. In some of these cases, one-on-one tutoring can be much more beneficial in helping a student succeed in a particular course. Potential tutors would be able to sign up and say which courses they would be comfortable in helping in. They would receive training and sign a confidentiality agreement to not disclose any information of the student that they would be tutoring. Based on this, we would offer tutoring services in various courses that other students could sign up for. This would ideally be able to help students improve their study skills and reduce the failure rate on tougher courses.</p>

<h3 id="work-with-the-faculty-to-improve-access-to-engineering-counsellors">Work with the Faculty to Improve Access to Engineering Counsellors</h3>

<p>Currently, Engineering Counsellors have a lot of their time taken up by appeals causing wait times for other issues to be upwards of a month. Additionally, the ratio of engineering counsellors to engineering students is still way too low. I would advocate to the faculty to either hire a full-time appeals counsellor, whose primary role would be to handle student appeals, or to find a way to free up counsellors time from appeals to reduce wait times for engineering students.</p>

<h3 id="create-an-action-plan-to-support-the-new-biomedical-students">Create an Action Plan to Support the new Biomedical Students</h3>

<p>This is the first time in six years that we will have a new program in Engineering. These students will not have upper year mentors to support and welcome them into engineering and the engineering society should help to fill that void. I will work with my fellow executive, Systems Design Engineering Department, and current SYDE students to ensure that students have the support and mentorship they need. Furthermore, we will try to ensure that any issues that arise with the program (courses, professors, facilities, jobs) are properly heard and fixed, so the students can have the best experience possible.</p>

<h2 id="co-op">Co-op</h2>

<p>CECA is always boasting about the number of employers that they have managed to attract to the school, yet there are still a lot of students who have trouble finding jobs to apply to that interest them. There are also a lot of changes coming to the faculty, with increased enrollment, 8-month co-ops and the potential elimination of the cohort system. My goal is to try to make it easier for students to find jobs that they want to do and to make sure first year students can find jobs with increased enrollment.</p>

<h3 id="increase-the-number-of-co-op-jobs-available-to-students">Increase the Number of Co-op Jobs Available to Students</h3>

<p>Many programs are still having a lot of issues with the quality and number of jobs available on Jobmine. This even includes many upper year students, who still are struggling to find jobs, even with over a year of experience. As a society, we need to use our relationships with external organizations like the PEO and other local companies, to try to attract more employers to hire Waterloo Engineering students are co-ops. I will specifically work with the VP-External to leverage the PEO, conference sponsors, guest speakers and local companies to accomplish this.</p>

<h3 id="investigate-the-impact-of-increased-enrolment-on-employment-rates">Investigate the Impact of Increased Enrolment on Employment Rates</h3>

<p>There will be a sizeable increase in the number of Mechatronics engineering students in this upcoming year. Mechatronics is a program that typically does not have issues finding employment. However,  4-Stream Mechanical and Electrical engineering students typically have a harder time finding employment in comparison. Even though the faculty has argued that adding another stream of Mechatronics students will not affect co-op numbers, the results that we are seeing during a typical term beg to differ. Similarly, the faculty has said that Biomedical Engineering students will not be competing with other programs for jobs, but the affect is still completely unknown. As a result, I will closely monitor the co-op situation for the 2019 first-year students to ensure that the influx or new students will not affect their employment prospects. Furthermore, I will keep in close contact with the faculty and CECA to ensure that they are prepared to handle these students in the co-op program.</p>

<h2 id="course-improvement">Course Improvement</h2>

<p>The easiest way to improve a student’s experience at Waterloo is to make sure that they take courses that they enjoy, and to ensure that the courses are well designed and taught. I have two main initiatives that I think will help improve both courses and course selection. </p>

<h3 id="develop-a-syllabus-bank">Develop a Syllabus Bank</h3>

<p>The course descriptions on the undergraduate calendar and department websites are inadequate in describing what the workload, content, and mark breakdown of a course could be. By creating a syllabus bank, we would be able to have a library of past offerings of courses, with all the details that students actually care about. This would also be simple to implement, by relying on the existing exam bank infrastructure on the EngSoc website to host and upload syllabuses.</p>

<h3 id="improve-the-quality-of-course-critiques">Improve the Quality of Course Critiques</h3>

<p>Course Critiques are an important part of improving teaching and course quality in Engineering. However, the questions that the critiques ask may not the most effective in giving course feedback. I would work with current and past course critique directors, the student body at large, and Gordon Stubley, the Associate Dean of Teaching, to improve course critiques.</p>
