    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is not actually a blog post but a summary of knowledge that was shared about the Software Engineering Fourth Year Design Project during the Winter 2014 term. As always this is subjective and could be different depending on circumstances.</p>

<h1 id="fydp-sessions">FYDP Sessions</h1>

  <li>UWFlow - uwflow.com</li>
  <li>The Notist - notist.co</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-they-wish-they-knew">What They wish they knew</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure your entire group isn’t taking trains, graphics, etc. all at the same time.</li>
  <li>Don’t work with your significant other. Group breakups are bad…</li>
  <li>Start generating ideas early on, even before starting on design project.
    <ul>
      <li>Keep a daily journal of ideas that come to mind and then discuss them with others</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keep a goal in mind for symposium (e.g. have lots of users) and work backwards from there</li>
  <li>If your application requires users launch early</li>
  <li>Don’t necessarily choose long-term technologies, it can be important to launch soon.</li>
  <li>Start early and launch early. It allows you to write higher quality code in the long run.</li>
  <li>If you are doing a research project, make sure it has good engineering. Good infrastructure, testing, build systems, etc. It can pay off in the long run (figuratively and literally).
    <ul>
      <li>Top two teams in 2014 had amazing infrastructure</li>
      <li>Build/Test infrastructure pushed Amalgam over the top</li>
      <li>The sponser loves this (=&gt; $$$)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Research code is awful. Make sure your code is actually good. Crappy code is really bad…
    <ul>
      <li>Apparently, Rayside’s code is not the WORST, but still bad</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Customer Definitions:
    <ul>
      <li>Research -&gt; Professor</li>
      <li>Open Source -&gt; Maintainers</li>
      <li>Corporate -&gt; Actually Client</li>
      <li>Entrepreneurial -&gt; More of a technical mentor</li>
      <li>Language will be clarified in 3B</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be pro-active about ideas, team, ideas.</li>
  <li>Schedule frequent meetings (Mixbox did 3 times a week). Used to work on the project</li>
  <li>Having one strong voice in the project to make defining decisions (Team Lead, Vocal People, etc.). Gives motivation and guidance</li>
  <li>If you get a lot of work done in the school terms, you most likely won’t get it done over the workterm
    <ul>
      <li>Hard to arrange meetings, communication, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Need good tools to figure what everyone is doing.
    <ul>
      <li>Pivotal Tracker for task planning (iterations)</li>
      <li>Hipchat for communication</li>
      <li>Github for Pull Requests + Code Reviews</li>
      <li>Helps for asynchronous communication</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Having a group member going on exchange can have a lot of difficulty
    <ul>
      <li>Weird meeting times because of time zones, exam times, etc.</li>
      <li>You don’t see them every day</li>
      <li>Workload won’t be balanced while on exchange</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Inter-disciplinary groups can have some unique quirks
    <ul>
      <li>Hard to schedule</li>
      <li>But can give a different perspective</li>

  </li>
  <li>80/90% of work will be done together</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>

<p>Q: Is there a good strategy for mitigating the co-op fall off (maintaining momentum during co-op)?</p>

<p>A1: Teams can potentially live together during a co-op term (may drive you insane). Be careful of doing this… REALLY CAREFUL!</p>

<p>A2: Chris &amp; Ming-Ho lived together and didn’t murder each other. Results may vary. Still tried to schedule regular meetings (cross-time-zone). Built the entire infrastucture during the co-op term. However, it was not completely steady throughout the work term. tldr; Meetings and if they didn’t do it would be bad.</p>

<p>A3: Research and actively still looking at projects etc. can help a lot during the term. Examples are testing, different libraries to speed up development. Play with “competitors” if you have them - could learn things.</p>

<p>A4: It may not be possible to work on it during a work term. Amazon, Google (Interns) and IBM are really bad at this. Keep this in mind.</p>

<p>A5: Set deadlines for yourself (not necessarily meaningful).</p>

<p>Q: What are measures of success for a FYDP?</p>

<p>A: Measured in technical content, results and communication. Less of a undergraduate marking scheme. Pick a project that someone will care about after your graudate and do a good job. Demonstrate how people care about your project. Project specific basis for success (going add examples). UWFlow is the low bar for  doing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project that everyone has tried before (did YCominbator pitch). We’ll get a list of projects that have done well as examples.</p>

<p>Q: How does a measure of success change if it is a taken over project?</p>

<p>A: Choose a project that as an extension is as ambitious as the original project. </p>

<p>Q: When do you know when you want to work on something?</p>

<p>A1: A lot of ideas will be pitched to us from various locations. Don’t worry too much about thinking of an amazing idea.</p>

<p>A2: Massive brainstorming sessions with people you want to work with can be useful.</p>

<p>A3: Can be a challenge to rally people around your idea, it may not be interesting to anyone but yourself. Think about what sorts of things you have in common with your classmates to direct ideas.</p>

<p>A4: This process will tried to be facilitated in 3B (SE 390). Keep all the other ideas for a potential SE499 (Independent project) if it doesn’t work out for FYDP.</p>

<p>A5: When deciding whether to organize an idea or a team, Mack says to organize around a team rather than an idea. Can usually find some interest. However, Rayside says to remain open-minded.</p>

    <link href="http://kapin.github.io/blog/2014/01/23/mine-all-the-jobs/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-23T14:34:00-08:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another term at Waterloo brings another round of hunting for the next co-op job using Jobmine. Jobmine is the wonderfully awful job board that we at Waterloo use to find our co-op jobs. The concept is pretty simple. A student applies to up to 50 postings (25 for me this time) and then employers go through the usual process of selecting people for interview. Once all the magic is done students will either get ranked, receive an offer or get rejected from the jobs they interviewed for. Then a stable marriage algorithm is run and bam, hopefully you have a job. There are a few more technical details, but almost every student at Waterloo experiences pretty much the same thing each term.</p>

<p>So the real question is why in the world am I writing about Jobmine? Well, if you happen to be a lucky employer who found my website on my Resume, then this post is just for you! If you aren’t, well, this is in “the spirit of why not?”</p>

<p>So back to talking about Jobmine. Each time I’ve used Jobmine there has been a different theme to what I was looking for. The first time (when I was in 2A), I wanted to work anywhere but Toronto. The second time I really wanted to go to California. This time around, location is less of a concern when compared to what I would be working on at whatever company I ended up with. The past two terms I’ve been doing iOS development and I’m ready for a change.</p>

<p>So, what exactly am I looking for then? I like the nuts and bolts of software, the application logic and less so the UI. I want to do server/backend development and I’m not willing to compromise this term. To get the most out of co-op, doing something different each term is incredibly important and doing mobile development again will not get me there.</p>

<p>So, with that, let the Jobmine games begin!</p>

    <link href="http://kapin.github.io/blog/2013/11/21/why-you-should-do-lunch-with-leaders/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-21T22:38:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://kapin.github.io/blog/2013/11/21/why-you-should-do-lunch-with-leaders</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months I’ve been interning at <a href="http://lookout.com">Lookout</a> in San Francisco. Besides being a totally badass place to work, there is an awesome tradition that all new hires and interns get to participate in called “Lunch With Leaders.” This weekly event, and associated company provided lunch is an opportunity for new employees and interns to get to know the executive team at the company. </p>

<p>Each lunch usually begins with the executive talking a bit about their background and why they ended up working at the company. From there, it usually turns into a Reddit style AMA where everyone can ask a variety of questions about pretty much everything.</p>

<h1 id="why-this-is-awesome">Why This is Awesome</h1>

<p>Lunch with Leaders helps break down that sometimes mythical barrier that separates employees from the higher ups at larger companies. Since Lookout has grown to what most would call a decent sized company (200+ employees), there is usually not too much interaction between someone like me (an intern) and the VP of Engineering due to general team autonomy. </p>

<p>The other thing that Lunch With Leaders takes advantage of is the connection between people and food. People generally like food and when you share food with people, it creates a bit of a bond. Doing this event at any other time would not have the same effect that it currently does.</p>

<h1 id="why-your-company-should-do-it">Why Your Company Should Do it</h1>

<p>So this all sounds awesome, but why should your company hold a Lunch With Leaders type of event? From personal experience, I can say that I’ve never felt such a connection to the fabric of the company before. Every single lunch I’ve heard a different reason why someone believes the company can succeed. I’ve also gained amazing insight into the thought process behind the various directions that company is heading currently and in the future. Lastly, it has shown a non-business side to the executive team of the company. Without this event, I’d never know that our CEO went to high school with Reel Big Fish or know additional insight into the wine industry from our CFO.</p>

<p>All in all, I can say that Lunch With Leaders has been one of the highest points of my internship this term. It’s inspired me to be a better person, engineer and to think a bit differently when it comes to the software industry. If that isn’t reason enough to give it a try at your company, I don’t know what is.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-08T22:54:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://kapin.github.io/blog/2013/11/08/blog-all-the-things</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well this is a long time coming to say the least. I’ve kept saying that I’m going to build my website since I started
at UW and well it is finally here.</p>

<p>This website is built with the magic that is known as <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> using the awesome <a href="https://github.com/alexgaribay/octoflat">Octoflat</a> theme.
I’ve tweaked a few things from the default theme and will hopefully change the colours around in the future to be a little less bright, but I’m incredibly happy that it is finally done.</p>

<h2 id="why-octopress">Why Octopress?</h2>

<p>First, I didn’t want to deal with the pain of setting up a hosting server to run a simple website. Octopress is built on top of Jekyll, a static page generator.
This allows me to write everything here in markdown, which is then converted into HTML when I deploy. Speaking of deploying, it is just as simple.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>Deploying Octopress </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">rake generate
</span><span class="line">rake deploy</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Lastly, the big thing that drew me to it was the vast array of themes and plugins. I’m not a designer nor do I really enjoy digging around in vast piles of HTML and CSS to create a website from scratch.
Having some awesome third party themes made it easy to start with someone’s awesome template and tweak it to my liking (as seen here).</p>

<p>I’ll keep it short for now but I’m glad I finally got this monkey off my back.</p>
