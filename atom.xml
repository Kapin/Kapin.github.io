    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another term at Waterloo brings another round of hunting for the next co-op job using Jobmine. Jobmine is the wonderfully awful job board that we at Waterloo use to find our co-op jobs. The concept is pretty simple. A student applies to up to 50 postings (25 for me this time) and then employers go through the usual process of selecting people for interview. Once all the magic is done students will either get ranked, receive an offer or get rejected from the jobs they interviewed for. Then a stable marriage algorithm is run and bam, hopefully you have a job. There are a few more technical details, but almost every student at Waterloo experiences pretty much the same thing each term.</p>

<p>So the real question is why in the world am I writing about Jobmine? Well, if you happen to be a lucky employer who found my website on my Resume, then this post is just for you! If you aren’t, well, this is in “the spirit of why not?”</p>

<p>So back to talking about Jobmine. Each time I’ve used Jobmine there has been a different theme to what I was looking for. The first time (when I was in 2A), I wanted to work anywhere but Toronto. The second time I really wanted to go to California. This time around, location is less of a concern when compared to what I would be working on at whatever company I ended up with. The past two terms I’ve been doing iOS development and I’m ready for a change.</p>

<p>So, what exactly am I looking for then? I like the nuts and bolts of software, the application logic and less so the UI. I want to do server/backend development and I’m not willing to compromise this term. To get the most out of co-op, doing something different each term is incredibly important and doing mobile development again will not get me there.</p>

<p>So, with that, let the Jobmine games begin!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months I’ve been interning at <a href="http://lookout.com">Lookout</a> in San Francisco. Besides being a totally badass place to work, there is an awesome tradition that all new hires and interns get to participate in called “Lunch With Leaders.” This weekly event, and associated company provided lunch is an opportunity for new employees and interns to get to know the executive team at the company. </p>

<p>Each lunch usually begins with the executive talking a bit about their background and why they ended up working at the company. From there, it usually turns into a Reddit style AMA where everyone can ask a variety of questions about pretty much everything.</p>

<h1 id="why-this-is-awesome">Why This is Awesome</h1>

<p>Lunch with Leaders helps break down that sometimes mythical barrier that separates employees from the higher ups at larger companies. Since Lookout has grown to what most would call a decent sized company (200+ employees), there is usually not too much interaction between someone like me (an intern) and the VP of Engineering due to general team autonomy. </p>

<p>The other thing that Lunch With Leaders takes advantage of is the connection between people and food. People generally like food and when you share food with people, it creates a bit of a bond. Doing this event at any other time would not have the same effect that it currently does.</p>

<h1 id="why-your-company-should-do-it">Why Your Company Should Do it</h1>

<p>So this all sounds awesome, but why should your company hold a Lunch With Leaders type of event? From personal experience, I can say that I’ve never felt such a connection to the fabric of the company before. Every single lunch I’ve heard a different reason why someone believes the company can succeed. I’ve also gained amazing insight into the thought process behind the various directions that company is heading currently and in the future. Lastly, it has shown a non-business side to the executive team of the company. Without this event, I’d never know that our CEO went to high school with Reel Big Fish or know additional insight into the wine industry from our CFO.</p>

<p>All in all, I can say that Lunch With Leaders has been one of the highest points of my internship this term. It’s inspired me to be a better person, engineer and to think a bit differently when it comes to the software industry. If that isn’t reason enough to give it a try at your company, I don’t know what is.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well this is a long time coming to say the least. I’ve kept saying that I’m going to build my website since I started
at UW and well it is finally here.</p>

<p>This website is built with the magic that is known as <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> using the awesome <a href="https://github.com/alexgaribay/octoflat">Octoflat</a> theme.
I’ve tweaked a few things from the default theme and will hopefully change the colours around in the future to be a little less bright, but I’m incredibly happy that it is finally done.</p>

<h2 id="why-octopress">Why Octopress?</h2>

<p>First, I didn’t want to deal with the pain of setting up a hosting server to run a simple website. Octopress is built on top of Jekyll, a static page generator.
This allows me to write everything here in markdown, which is then converted into HTML when I deploy. Speaking of deploying, it is just as simple.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>Deploying Octopress </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">rake generate
</span><span class="line">rake deploy</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Lastly, the big thing that drew me to it was the vast array of themes and plugins. I’m not a designer nor do I really enjoy digging around in vast piles of HTML and CSS to create a website from scratch.
Having some awesome third party themes made it easy to start with someone’s awesome template and tweak it to my liking (as seen here).</p>

<p>I’ll keep it short for now but I’m glad I finally got this monkey off my back.</p>
