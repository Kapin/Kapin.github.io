Hi, I’m Josh. I’m currently studying Software Engineering at Waterloo and just finished up my 4A term. I'm currently working at Square as an intern on the Analytics and Reporting Server team.

In the past I've worked at Microsoft in Redmond, Lookout in San Francisco, Enflick in Waterloo, and Salesforce.com in Toronto. I am also a huge bookworm and music nut. For all my technical goodness check out my Github page and my resume.
