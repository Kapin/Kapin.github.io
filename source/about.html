Hi, I’m Joshua Kalpin. I’m currently studying Software Engineering at Waterloo going into my 4A term. I’m currently interning at Microsoft for a second time working on the Internet of Things. In the past I've worked at Lookout in San Francisco, Enflick in Waterloo, and Salesforce.com in Toronto previously. I am also a huge bookworm and music nut. For all my technical goodness checkout my Github page and my resume.
