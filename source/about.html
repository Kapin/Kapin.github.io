Hi, I'm Joshua Kalpin. I'm currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo and interning at Lookout in San Francisco.
I'm an active contributer to CocoaPods and love taking on weird, and interesting challenges. I've interned at Salesforce.com in Toronto
and Enflick in Waterloo in the past. I am also a huge bookworm and music nut.
