Hi, I’m Joshua Kalpin. I’m currently studying Software Engineering at Waterloo and am in my 3A term. I’m an active contributor to CocoaPods and love taking on weird, and interesting challenges. I’ve interned at Lookout in San Francisco, Enflick in Waterloo, and Salesforce.com in Toronto previously. I am also a huge bookworm and music nut. For all my technical goodness checkout my Github page and my resume.
