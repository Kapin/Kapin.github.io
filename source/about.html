Hi, I'm Joshua Kalpin. I'm currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo and interning at Lookout in San Francisco.
I'm an active contrbuter to CocoaPods and love taking on weird, and interesting challenges. I've also interned at Salesforce.com in Toronto
and Enflick in Waterloo and am a huge bookworm and music nut.
