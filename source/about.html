Hi, I’m Josh. I’m currently studying Software Engineering at Waterloo going into my 4A term. I’m also just finishing up my second at Microsoft with the Internet of Things group.

In the past I've worked at Lookout in San Francisco, Enflick in Waterloo, and Salesforce.com in Toronto. I am also a huge bookworm and music nut. For all my technical goodness check out my Github page and my resume.
